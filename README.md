💡 here's the idea

- there is a lot of programming languages, libraries and frameworks out there to build software for web and mobile
- each of them has their own set of goals, philosophies, caveats, capabilities, pros and cons
- yet, frameworks have become the most effective and simplified abstraction in software development

💭 what if, 
  - we build a web framework from the ground up, 
  - putting together everything that we have learned so far,
  - experiment, iterate and reason with first principles regarding the languages/tools/platforms of choice, design and architecture
  - with a goal of viablity, simplicity and better developer experience
  - it is more about the community and concepts(that will be the main and constant driver) than the code
